Release notes for Valgrind, version 2.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
KDE3 developers: please read also README_KDE3_FOLKS for guidance
about how to debug KDE3 applications with Valgrind.

If you are building a binary package of Valgrind for distribution,
please read README_PACKAGERS.  It contains some important information.

If you are developing Valgrind, please read README_DEVELOPERS.  It contains
some useful information.

For instructions on how to build/install, see the end of this file.


Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Valgrind is a tool to help you find memory-management problems in your
programs. When a program is run under Valgrind's supervision, all
reads and writes of memory are checked, and calls to
malloc/new/free/delete are intercepted. As a result, Valgrind can
detect problems such as:

   Use of uninitialised memory 
   Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd 
   Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks 
   Reading/writing inappropriate areas on the stack 
   Memory leaks -- where pointers to malloc'd blocks are lost forever
   Passing of uninitialised and/or unaddressible memory to system calls
   Mismatched use of malloc/new/new [] vs free/delete/delete [] 
   Overlaps of arguments to strcpy() and related functions
   Some abuses of the POSIX pthread API

Problems like these can be difficult to find by other means, often
lying undetected for long periods, then causing occasional,
difficult-to-diagnose crashes.

When Valgrind detects such a problem, it can, if you like, attach GDB
to your program, so you can poke around and see what's going on.

Valgrind is licensed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A comprehensive user guide is supplied.  Point your browser at
$PREFIX/share/doc/valgrind/manual.html, where $PREFIX is whatever you
specified with --prefix= when building.  


Building and installing it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To install from a tar.bz2 distribution:

  1. Run ./configure, with some options if you wish. The standard
     options are documented in the INSTALL file.  The only interesting
     one is the usual --prefix=/where/you/want/it/installed.

  2. Do "make".

  3. Do "make install", possibly as root if the destination permissions
     require that.

  4. See if it works.  Try "valgrind ls -l".  Either this works,
     or it bombs out complaining it can't find argc/argv/envp.
     In that case, mail me a bug report.

Important!  Do not move the valgrind installation into a place
different from that specified by --prefix at build time.  This will
cause things to break in subtle ways, mostly when Valgrind handles
fork/exec calls.
