Julian Seward, jseward@acm.org, is the original author.

Nicholas Nethercote, njn25@cam.ac.uk, did the core/skin
generalisation, and wrote Cachegrind and some of the other skins, and
generally hacked on just about every part of the system by now.

Jeremy Fitzhardinge, jeremy@goop.org, contributed tons of
improvements, including the Helgrind thread-checking tool.

readelf's dwarf2 source line reader, written by Nick Clifton, was
modified to be used in Valgrind by Daniel Berlin.

Michael Matz and Simon Hausmann modified the GNU binutils
demangler(s) for use in Valgrind.

Dirk Mueller contrib'd the malloc-free mismatch checking stuff
and various other bits and pieces.

Lots of other people sent bug reports, patches, and very 
helpful feedback.  I thank you all.
